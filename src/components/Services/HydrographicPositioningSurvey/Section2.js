              Our hydrographic and positioning surveys provide high-resolution
              depth and spatial data to support marine construction, navigation,
              cable routing, dredging, and offshore energy projects.

              By using uncrewed survey vehicles and real-time GNSS technology,
              we operate in areas traditional vessels canâ€™t reach, while
              improving safety and operational efficiency. Whether in ports or
              open waters, we deliver data that meets international standards
              and is tailored to the unique terrain of African coastlines.
